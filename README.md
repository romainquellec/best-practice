# best-practices

The principles underpinning these recommendations are:

* Software engineers solve business problems, code is a means not a goal
* Programming is a social activity, source code is communication
* Attention is the most precious resource in a project
* Simplicity is the best ally in the long run
* The only problem to solve is the one we have today
